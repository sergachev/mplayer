unwarpvr for ffmpeg from here: github.com/eVRydayVR/ffmpeg-unwarpvr
(yes, you could use ffplay, but the latency is too high, that's why I've ported this filter to mplayer)


usage:
./mplayer -vf unwarpvr <your video source>

sometimes it fails, just try to run few times ;)

(can use fifo output from https://github.com/pierrezurek/Samples/tree/master/Unix/BebopDroneReceiveStream as video source)
